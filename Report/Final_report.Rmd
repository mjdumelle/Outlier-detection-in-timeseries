## INTRODUCTION

## THEORETICAL RESULTS

### Types of outlier in ARIMA model 
We say that $x_t$ folows an ARIMA (p,d,q) model if $x_t$ can be written 

#### Additive outliers (AO)
An additive outlier (AO) correspond to an exogenous change of a single observation of the time series. It is associated with inciden like measurement errors or impulse effect due to external effect. 

#### Innovative Outliers 

#### Temporal Change outliers 

#### Level Shifts Outliers
